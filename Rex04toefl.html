                    "[A] Before the age of the smartphone, aspiring photographers had to learn how to use high-tech cameras and photographic techniques. Not everyone had cameras, and it took skill and a good eye to capture and create a great photograph. Today, with the huge range of camera apps on our smartphones, we are all amateur photographers. And pretty good ones, too: The quality of smartphone images now nearly equals that of digital cameras.",
                    "[B] The new ease of photography has given us a tremendous appetite for capturing the magical and the ordinary. We are obsessed with documenting everyday moments, whether it's a shot of our breakfast, our cat - or the cat's breakfast. And rather than collect pictures in scrapbooks, we share, like, and comment on them with friends and strangers around the globe.",
                    "[C] Even photojournalists are experimenting with cell phones because their near invisibility makes it easier to capture unguarded moments. The Internet also allows photojournalists to avoid traditional media. They can now act as their own publishers - reaching huge audiences via social media sites such as Instagram.",
                    "[D] In the past, magazines published unforgettable photos of important people and global events that captured our imaginations. These photos had the power to change public opinion - even the course of history. But if there are fewer memorable images today, it's not because there are fewer good images: It's because there are so many.",
                    "[E] Cameras are everywhere - a situation that is transforming the way we experience dramatic events. When there are major political events or natural disasters, it is ordinary citizens with cell phones - not photojournalists - who often provide the first news images.",
                    "[F] As people everywhere embrace photography and the media make use of citizen journalists, professional standards appear to be shifting. In the past, most people trusted photojournalists to accurately represent reality. Today, however, digital images can be altered in ways the naked eye might never notice.",
                    "[G] The question of the accuracy of images gets even trickier when photojournalists start experimenting with camera apps - like Flickr or Instagram - which encourage the use of filters. Images can be colored, brightened, faded, and scratched to make photographs more artistic, or to give them an antique look. Critics worry that antique-looking photographs romanticize war, while distancing us from those who fight in them.",
                    "[H] Yet, photography has always been more subjective than we assume. Each picture is a result of a series of decisions - where to stand, what lens to use, and what to leave in or out of the frame. Does altering photographs with camera app filters make them less true?",
                    "[I] There's something powerful and exciting about the experiment that the digital age has forced upon us. These new tools make it easier to tell our own stories, and they give others the power to do the same.",
                    "[J] The increase in the number of photographs and photographers might even be good for democracy itself. Hundreds of millions of potential citizen journalists make the world smaller and help keep leaders honest.",
                    "[K] Who knows? Our obsession with documentation and constantly being connected could lead to a radical change in our way of being. Perhaps we are witnessing the development of a universal visual language. Of course, as with any language, there will be those who produce poetry and those who make shopping lists.",
                    "[L] It's not clear whether this flowering of image-making will lead to a public that better appreciates and understands images. Or will it simply numb us to the profound effects a well-made image can have? Regardless, the change is irreversible. Let's hope the millions of new photographs made today help us see what we all have in common."

                    "[A] One cloudless midsummer day, biologist Andrew Parker knelt in the baking red sand of an Australian desert and gently placed the right back leg of a thorny devil into a dish of water. The thorny devil - a small lizard that has learned to survive in the extreme heat of the Australian desert - has a secret that fascinated Parker. 'Look, look!' he exclaimed. 'Its back is completely drenched!' Sure enough, in less than a minute, water from the dish had traveled up the lizard's leg, across its skin, and into its mouth. It was, in essence, drinking through its foot. The thorny devil can also do this when standing on wet sand - a vital competitive advantage in the desert. Parker had come here to solve the riddle of how it does this, not from purely biological interest, but with a specific purpose in mind: to make a device to help people collect water in the desert.",
                    "[B] Parker is a leading scientist in the field of biomimetics - applying designs from nature to solve problems in engineering, materials science, medicine, and other fields. His studies of the body coverings of butterflies and beetles have led to brighter screens for cell phones. He has even drawn inspiration from nature's past: While visiting a museum in Poland, he noticed a 45-million-year-old fly trapped in amber and observed how the shape of its eye's surface reduced light reflection. This shape is now being used in solar panels to make them more efficient.",
                    "[C] As part of the next phase in his plan to create a water-collection device inspired by the lizard, Parker sent his observations to Michael Rubner and Robert Cohen, two colleagues at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Parker is full of enthusiasm about the many possibilities of biomimetics. Rubner and Cohen, on the other hand, are much more practical; they focus on the ideas that have a chance of being applied successfully. This combination of biological insight and engineering pragmatism is vital to success in biomimetics. And it has led to several promising technologies.",
                    "[D] Though Rubner and Cohen are certainly impressed by biological structures, they consider nature just a starting point for innovation. Cohen says, 'The natural structure provides a clue to what is useful ... But maybe you can do it better.' They consider a biomimetics project a success only if it has the potential to make a useful tool for people. 'Looking at pretty structures in nature is not sufficient,' says Cohen. 'What I want to know is can we actually transform these structures into [something] with true utility in the real world?'",
                    "[E] The work of Parker, Rubner, and Cohen is only one part of a growing global biomimetics movement. Scientists around the world are studying and trying to copy a wide variety of nature's design secrets.",
                    "[F] Potentially, one of the most useful applications of biomimetics is the robot. Professor Ronald Fearing of the University of California is creating a tiny robot fly that can be used in surveillance or rescue operations.",
                    "[G] At Stanford University in California, Mark Cutkosky is working on a robot gecko. Cutkosky studied the extremely small structures on the tiny lizard's feet that allow it to run up and down vertical walls. He applied what he learned to create Stickybot, a robot that can walk up and down smooth vertical surfaces.",
                    "[H] Despite the promise of the field and the brilliant people who work in it, biomimetics has led to surprisingly few business successes. Perhaps only one product has become truly famous - Velcro. But the main reason biomimetics hasn't yet been a business success is that nature is incredibly complex.",
                    "[I] Nonetheless, the gap with nature is gradually closing. Researchers are using more powerful microscopes, high-speed computers, and other new technologies to learn more from nature."

Only recently have scientists begun to understand where these amazing voyagers came from, and how - with simple canoes and no navigation equipment - they reached hundreds of islands scattered across an ocean that covers nearly a third of the globe.",

Then, for unknown reasons, they stopped. There was an interval of around 1,000 years before the Polynesian civilization - descendants of the Lapita - launched a new period of exploration.",

Rather than give all the credit to their bravery and technique, Atholl Anderson thinks that they might also have been lucky - helped by El Niño.",
                    "[H] El Niño occurs in the Pacific Ocean when the surface water temperature is unusually high. One of its effects is to cause trade winds in the South Pacific to weaken or to reverse direction and blow to the east. Scientists believe that El Niño phenomena were unusually frequent around the time of the Lapita expansion.",

                    "[A] According to the European Banking Authority, a virtual currency is 'a digital representation of value that is neither issued by a central bank or a public authority, nor necessarily attached to a fiat currency, but is accepted as a means of payment and can be transferred, stored, or traded electronically.' There are many types of virtual currency, but the best known is probably Bitcoin.",
                    "[B] In online articles, or in newspapers or magazines, you may have seen pictures of gold or silver coins marked with the Bitcoin symbol. However - since Bitcoins exist only as digital constructs - these are merely representations. Bitcoin is a type of digital money known as a 'cryptocurrency'.",
                    "[C] Unlike traditional currencies, Bitcoin is not controlled by a central bank or by a government agency. And unlike credit cards, the Bitcoin network is not run by a company. It is operated by a global network of computers called a blockchain network, which records every Bitcoin transaction in the world.",
                    "[D] The first reference to Bitcoin appeared in 2008, in a paper by a writer supposedly named Satoshi Nakamoto. However, the name turned out to be a pseudonym for a person or group who preferred to remain anonymous. A year later, Bitcoin was released as open-source software.",
                    "[E] Bitcoin was not the first attempt at a cryptocurrency; others had existed in one form or another for nearly 50 years, but without much success. In a short space of time, though, Bitcoin became the first cryptocurrency to be widely traded internationally.",
                    "[F] In its early days, Bitcoin was known for its link with illegal drugs, such as those bought and sold on Silk Road, an online black market set up in 2011. Silk Road was shut down by the FBI in 2013. According to some experts, the shutdown gave Bitcoin a chance to gain some much-needed legitimacy.",
                    "[G] Each Bitcoin can be divided out to eight decimal places. That means you can send someone a minimum of 0.00000001 Bitcoins. This smallest fraction of a Bitcoin - the penny of the Bitcoin world - is called a 'Satoshi.'",
                    "[H] Like gold or other precious metals used as money, Bitcoins are scarce. But their scarcity is not natural or accidental. New Bitcoins are added only by being 'mined.' Computer users on the blockchain network race to solve increasingly complicated mathematical problems.",
                    "[I] A useful analogy: Think of the blockchain network as an engine. Engines can be used to power all types of vehicles: cars, boats, aircraft. Bitcoin is a vehicle that uses that engine. Because it was the first major virtual currency to use blockchain, you could think of Bitcoin as an early model vehicle, like a Model T Ford.",
                    "[J] In most cases, financial transactions involve exchange fees, taxes, and payment delays to guard against fraud. Virtual transactions, however, are speedy and cheap - and are settled immediately.",
                    "[K] Virtual currencies also make it possible to make a digital payment without needing PayPal or a credit card. This is particularly useful in many parts of Africa, Latin America, and South Asia. Immigrants to developed countries may find it a convenient way to send funds back home to their families.",
                    "[L] Bitcoin supporter Jonathan Mohan says, 'The vast majority of people on the planet don't even own a bank account … In these developing nations, you're not going to see them start getting bank accounts. You're going to see them just going straight to Bitcoins.'",
                    "[M] The most obvious drawback is a lack of stability in the value of the currency. Bitcoin's independence makes it more stable in principle than traditional currencies. In reality, though, its value has fluctuated wildly over the time it has been in existence.",
                    "[N] So it is worth thinking twice before putting all or a substantial amount of your assets into a virtual currency like Bitcoin. The rule of investing in virtual currency is the same as investing in stocks: Never invest more than you can afford to lose."
