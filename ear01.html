It’s produced by the same company that made Road Jam a few years ago, which was set in a city of course. Instead of streets and huge buildings, though, you’ll find yourself living in a rainforest in this game.</p><p>It’s an unusual game because you have to answer questions in order to make progress, as well as by moving through the environment. You’ll be asked all sorts of things regarding insects, which you have to learn on the way from the many helpful creatures you meet, such as butterflies and bats.</p><p>There are 30 levels in the whole game, which are supposed to become more and more challenging as you go on. I found the one called ‘the monkey’ almost impossible, even though it comes well before the last level, called ‘the frog’, which didn’t seem so difficult.</p><p>There are lots of things to love about this game. The story you learn about as you continue through the game is fantastic, second only to the characters you can play, who are lovely, and extremely interesting too. Learning to play the game is easy and fun, too.</p><p>Unfortunately, unlike the eight players who could play against each other in Road Jam, six people at the most can join in this game at any one time. I found this to be a few too many, though, and preferred playing in a group of four.</p><p>You can find out more about the game online. If you’re interested, visit the company’s website www.lombardio.com. I’ll spell that for you: it’s L-O-M-B-A-R-D-I-O.</p>`,

As you’ll probably remember, last year’s competition asked you to focus on the topic of travel, but photos should have something to do with the environment this time.</p><p>As in previous years, there are certain things that we want the photographs to include. We want all the pictures to have wildlife in them, so we’re not looking for photos that only show landscapes or people.</p><p>The head teacher has decided to ask someone from outside the school to judge the competition this year. She was hoping that local artist Sally Graves would be able to judge the entries, but she’s actually away at that time. Writer James McKay has agreed to help us instead. I’m sure many of you have heard of him, as he’s quite famous and was born not far away from here, too.</p><p>It was felt that most keen photographers already have the photography books or equipment they need, so the organisers have decided that the winner will receive a photography course run by Central College instead. The College was also hoping to have a small photography exhibition for winners of all the school photography competitions in the area, but their gallery’s too busy putting on other shows, I’m afraid.</p><p>The winner of the competition will be announced on 11th March. If you wish to enter, please make sure we receive your photos by 15th February, as the judging will take place on 19th February.</p><p>So if you’re interested, send your entry to the school secretary, Mrs Mitchell, not to me or the head teacher. I’ll give you her email address – it’s k dot Mitchell, that’s spelt M-I-T-C-H-E-double-L at school dot com. Good luck!</p>`,

We’re really lucky to have someone who’s actually quite famous. Her name’s Alice Fisher, and she’s appearing in a play at the big theatre in town at the moment. She plays a policewoman in that, but you’ll probably know her better as the farmer in the series ‘Green Valley’ that was on last year.</p><p>She’s worked as a professional theatre actor for about 10 years. As well as having three years’ experience of appearing in serious drama, she’s also spent seven years working in comedy productions, so has lots of different talents.</p><p>The sessions are always fun and are split into two sections. In the first part, rather than practising anything to do with movement of the body, we focus instead on improving how to control the voice as an actor. In the second part, we practise our performance skills.</p><p>If you’re interested in coming to the drama club, you’ll need to know where to come, of course. The club actually hires a room from the university to run the classes. It’s much cheaper to do it there than at the college or the acting school. The sessions are on Wednesday evenings.</p><p>At the moment, we’re practising for a play, which will be on at the Town Theatre soon. Its name is ‘The Passenger’ and we’re hoping that this latest one will be as popular as the last production the club did, which was called ‘Reality’. It was a big success, apparently.</p><p>We’ve got our last practice for the new play on the thirteenth of July, with audiences able to come and see it from twentieth of July for one week.</p><p>Thanks for listening.</p>`,

We spent ages looking around the room that was all about space’ and even longer in the one with loads of stuff on ‘energy’, which I thought was the best bit.</p><p>The museum’s free, but there are also two special exhibitions that you have to pay for. You can’t go into the one on ’health’ yet because it doesn’t open for another couple of weeks. I’d like to go back and see that. The other exhibition on ‘computers’ was good, though.</p><p>As well as the displays, there are lots of things you can actually do there too. My brother made this fantastic car that went quite fast, using only power from the sun, while I created a rocket that used gas to fly. It went really high!</p><p>As well as the interesting things to see and do, there’s a nice shop. My mum and dad let me get something because it was my birthday. There were so many chemistry sets to choose from, it took me ages to decide which one I wanted. They have the usual toys and games, and a few nice books there, too.</p><p>You can also take a tour of the museum with a guide. When we arrived, they said we’d have to wait for at least sixty minutes for the eighty-minute tour because it was so popular, so we decided against it.</p><p>If you want to go, the entrance is on Lockhart Road. I’ll spell that for you, it’s L-O-C-K-H-A-R-T Road.</p><p>Thanks for listening.</p>`,

I know some of you are interested in learning to play a musical instrument so I have some information about Saturday morning music classes that are starting this week.</p><p>There are many classes to choose from for a range of different instruments. You can learn anything from the drums to the guitar. The violin teacher the school usually uses can’t make it on Saturdays, but why not have a go at the flute if you prefer classical music.</p><p>When you arrive at the school, you’ll need to collect your instruments. You probably know that these are normally kept in the large cupboard next to the technology room but we’ll make sure they’re all ready for you in the drama room so go straight there, please.</p><p>You’ll need to tell your parents about the cost, of course. They can pay in two different ways: if they decide to pay for each individual class, it’ll be £7.75, or they can pay per term, in which case it works out a little cheaper at £72.</p><p>There’ll be an end of term concert for all students, which will take place on 24th June, and not on 7th July as it says on the school website. You’ll be able to play solo, that’s by yourself, or with others. Last year, there were several students who joined together in a band and they played together at the concert. This year, though, we’d like to include more people and have an orchestra that students can play in. Family and friends are welcome to come and listen.</p><p>If you or your parents want more information, you’ll need to email Mr Driscoll, the music teacher on driscoll at school dot net. I’ll spell that for you: it’s D-R-I-S-C-O-double-L at school dot net.</p>`,

There are always charity shops which are very happy to help you recycle your old clothes or things in the house. Knowing that someone else is getting pleasure from something you no longer need is a lovely feeling.</p><p>Pollution is of course a big problem, and we often feel that as individuals we have no power to make any difference.

Get together with friends and help to clear the rubbish from local rivers or collect litter from the streets around your home to keep the area looking tidy.</p><p>Finally, let’s turn to energy. Cars are here to stay for the moment, and it would be difficult to ask people not to use them at all. But we should all try to avoid making unnecessary car journeys. Go by bike or public transport sometimes or, if you work in the same area as your neighbour, try car-sharing. Take it in turns to drive to work.</p>`,

Everything went well though and he was so pleased when his first flight was behind him.</p><p>He often gets nervous people asking him questions about how dangerous flying really is. He tells them that it is the safest way to travel. However, sometimes unexpected things happen during a flight, such as bad weather or difficult passengers, but he says that the most important thing a pilot can do is to always stay calm.</p><p>My father believes that what nervous passengers have in common is that they need to be in control of their life and when they get on a plane they have to give up that control.</p><p>He always does his best to make passengers feel relaxed on the flight.

They said a common mistake is to stand too far away from the person. You get a much better result if you get close to them as they take up more of the photo. It’s also important to make sure the camera is at the same height as the person, especially if you’re taking one of a child.</p><p>A really useful tip was to pay attention to the background. The person will stand out much more if the background is as plain as possible. This will help you to focus on the subject of your photo.</p><p>Although most smartphones come with a flash to provide extra light, they suggested we try to make as much use as possible of daylight. Doing this will make the colours more accurate and the photo will appear more natural.</p><p>We’re all used to asking someone to ‘say cheese’ when we’re about to take their photo. To get a more interesting picture, they recommended taking a photo of the person when they don’t know you’re about to do it. Perhaps they’re reading or looking out of the window.</p><p>Finally, they told us to take plenty of photos so we can practise our skills. They said we should aim to take at least three photos of people every day. These can be of friends and family or even strangers, if you ask their permission.</p>`,

There’s always a maximum of 15 in the class, and a minimum of eight. Before we start, I’d like to tell you about the course. Some of the information you’ll probably know already, but some of it has changed.</p><p>Your class will still be on Tuesday evenings, but it won’t start at seven o’clock. It will start at the later time of 7.30, and will end at 9.30, not nine o’clock. I hope that change is OK for everyone. Unfortunately I can’t be here any earlier than that. Another change is the room. Next week we need to move to the second floor to the room opposite the art room. That’s Room 26. Today is the only time we’ll be here in Room 12.</p><p>The coursebook will be the same as before, that is Starting French. I see some of you have already bought it – that’s good. However, if you want to buy it from us, it costs £8. You can order it today, but it takes two weeks so you won’t have it until 1st October.</p><p>One more thing … during the last week of term, there is an International Evening at the college. There will be traditional dancing from different countries and every class is asked to provide some food. I thought we could take some French cheese, but any other suggestions are welcome.</p><p>And finally, let me remind you that most of your lessons will be completely in French. So, let’s begin …</p>`,

It’s quite big, and it’s full of water from the river, not the sea, because I’ve got freshwater fish. It’s a bit of work to look after. I have to clean it once a month, which takes a couple of hours. But it’s worth it. I love watching the fish swim around. I’ve got about ten different kinds. My favourites are the ones with bright red and yellow stripes. They’re so beautiful. I’ve put a big rock in the middle of the aquarium and a plastic castle, so the fish have places to hide. It’s funny to see them disappear and then come out again. I’d like to add some plants to the aquarium next, to make it look more natural. I spend a lot of time on the internet, reading about different types of fish and how to look after them. There’s so much to learn.</p>`,

It was amazing to see them so close up. We saw lots of other animals, like tigers and monkeys. But my favourite animals were the penguins. They were so funny, waddling around and diving into the water. I was surprised by the giraffes. I thought they would be shy, but they were actually very friendly and came right up to the fence. For lunch, we went to a café near the lake. It was nice to sit outside and watch the ducks. Before we left, I went to the gift shop. I didn’t have much money, but I bought a postcard with a picture of a baby elephant on it to send to my friend.</p>`,

We are currently looking for more volunteers to help us out. We need people to work in our charity shops. The main job involves sorting through the donations that people bring us, like clothes and books, and getting them ready to be sold. We are looking for people who can give us at least four hours of their time a week, on a regular basis. You don’t need any special skills or experience to be a volunteer, just a willingness to help and a friendly attitude. If you are interested in joining our team, please visit our website and complete the online application form. We’d love to hear from you.</p>`,
