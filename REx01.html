Most of us keep dreaming; others make it happen.\n[B] Gregg Bleakney's dream was to travel the Americas from top to bottom. He got the idea after he finished a 1,600-kilometer bike ride. Gregg's friend Brooks Allen was also a cyclist. The two friends talked and decided on their goal: They would travel from Alaska to Argentina - by bike.\n[C] To pay for the journey, Gregg and Brooks worked and saved money for years. In 2005, after four years of planning, they set off. Once they were on the road, they often camped outdoors or stayed in hostels. In many places along their route, local people opened their homes to the two friends and gave them food.\n[D] During their trip, Gregg and Brooks cycled through deserts, rain forests, and mountains. They visited modern cities and explored ancient ruins, such as Tikal in Guatemala. In many places, they met other cyclists from all over the world.\n[E] In May 2007 - two years, 12 countries, and over 30,500 km later - Gregg eventually reached Ushuaia, Argentina, at the southern tip of South America. (Halfway through the trip, Brooks had to stop. He returned to the United States and Gregg continued without him.)\n[F] Gregg and Brooks kept a record of their adventures in an online blog.

But for those interested in adventure and sport, there is a lot to do. Some of the best swimming, snorkeling, and sea kayaking can be found here. Vanuatu's islands also offer visitors two of the most exciting - and dangerous - activities in the world: volcano surfing and land diving.\n[B] On Tanna Island, Mount Yasur rises 300 meters into the sky. Yasur is one of Vanuatu's few active volcanoes. It erupts almost every day, sometimes several times a day. For centuries, both locals and tourists have climbed this mountain to visit the top. Recently, people have also started climbing Yasur to surf the volcano. In some ways, volcano surfing is like surfing in the sea, but in other ways, it's very different. A volcano surfer's goal is to escape the erupting volcano - without being hit by flying rocks! It's fast, fun, and dangerous - the perfect extreme sport.\n[C] Most people are familiar with bungee jumping. But did you know that bungee jumping started on Pentecost Island in Vanuatu almost 15 centuries ago? The original activity - called land diving - is part of a religious ceremony.
